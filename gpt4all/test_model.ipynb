      ", there are some disadvantages to using Django framework. One major issue is that it can be more difficult to set up and configure than other web application frameworks like Ruby on Rails or AngularJS. Additionally, Django's documentation can sometimes be lacking in certain areas, which can make it challenging for beginners to get started with the framework. Finally, due to its open-source nature, some features may not be available or may require additional third-party libraries or plugins.\n"
